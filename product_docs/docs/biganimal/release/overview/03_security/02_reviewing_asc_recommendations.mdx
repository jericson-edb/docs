To increase your security, review Azure Security Center's recommendations page for actions you can take to raise your security score. See this section for information on why you might be seeing a particular alert and whether you can take steps to improve the security in your cluster.

## Restricted access to host network and a range of ports - Medium

To avoid the possibility of a compromised container, Azure Security Center recommends restricting access to the host network for Kubernetes pods as well as restricting pod access to an allowable range of ports on the host. 

BigAnimal must run some containers that may use the node network namespace to monitor the network traffic statistics of Kubernetes cluster worker nodes. To prevent any traffic sniffing and configuration changes to the worker node system, BigAnimal has removed all security capabilities for those containers. **IS THAT TEXT ACCURATE? SOURCE MATERIAL WAS NOT CLEAR?**

For more information about restricting access, go to **Home > Microsoft Defender for the Cloud > Recommendations**. Expand **Restrict unauthorized network access**, select **Usage of host networking and ports should be restricted** and follow the recommendations provided there.

## Azure Firewall - Low

BigAnimal does not enable the Azure Firewall. Instead, BigAnimal uses Azure Network Security Group whitelists to specify permissible inbound and outbound.

If your organization requires an Azure Firewall for compliance purposes, contact [support@biganimal.com](mailto:support@biganimal.com).

## Privileged containers

Azure recommends avoiding privileged containers because they have all the root capabilities of a host machine. However, BigAnimal must run some containers in privileged mode for control plane functionality such as securing and monitoring the application.

## Immutable read-only root file systems

Azure recommends that containers should run with a read-only root file system in a Kubernetes cluster. Immutable file systems can prevent malicious changes at run-time. 

BigAnimal must run some containers that must run with a read-only root filesystem for control plane functionality, for example, to use system calls to secure and monitor our application. **IS THAT STATEMENT CORRECT?**

For more information about restricting access, go to **Home > Microsoft Defender for the Cloud > Recommendations**. Expand **Manage access and permissions**, select **Immutable (read-only) root filesystem should be enforced for containers** and follow the recommendations provided there.

## Disable automounting API credentials

Azure recommmends disabling automounting API credentials to prevent a potentially compromised pod running API commands against a Kubernetes cluster. 

To prevent this scenario, BigAnimal created service accounts and roles with least privileges for Kubernetes operators and operands.

## Containers should not run as root

Azure recommends that containers should not run as root. Running a process as the root user inside a container runs it as root on the host. If there's a compromise, an attacker has root in the container.

BigAnimal must run some containers as root users to provide some control plane functionality, for example, to deliver logging functionality. BigAnimal tightly restrict use of the root user, and no containers running as root expose network connectivity.
