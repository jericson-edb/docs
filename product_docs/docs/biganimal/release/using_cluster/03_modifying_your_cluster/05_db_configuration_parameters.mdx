title: Modifying database configuration parameters
---

The database parameters listed on the DB Configuration tab are also referred to as Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) variables. See [What Is a GUC Variable?](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/what-guc-variable) for more information.

The list of parameters is populated based on the type of database you selected on the **Operational Settings** tab when you created your cluster. For more information about the parameters for your database type:

-   For Postgres parameters, see [Setting Parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html) and [Server Configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html) in the Postgres documentation.
     

-   For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Summary of Configuration Parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/#summary_of_configuration_parameters) and [Configuration Parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/).

!!!note
Not all database configuration parameters are supported by BigAnimal. Some parameters, such as `wal_level` and `restore_command`, are reserved for EDB to provide the managed database features of BigAnimal.

## Modify a parameter

1.  Go to the parameter you want to modify using these methods:
    -   To search for a specific parameter, use the search field. 
    -   To filter the parameters that show, select one of the following in the **Show only** list:
        -   Custom Values — Shows only parameters that changed from the default values, either in the current session or modified in a previous session and applied to the cluster.
        -   Currently Edited Values — Shows only parameters that changed during the current editing session.

2.  Enter the new value in the parameter value field. See [Parameter Names and Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-NAMES-VALUES) for more information on the types of values parameters accept.

   !!! Danger 
   Parameters identified with a yellow exclamation point icon trigger a restart when you save your changes. The restart terminates all open connections and takes a few minutes to complete. It takes a few more seconds for the new connection to establish. During this process, it isn't possible to connect to the database.
   !!!

3.  Save your changes.
