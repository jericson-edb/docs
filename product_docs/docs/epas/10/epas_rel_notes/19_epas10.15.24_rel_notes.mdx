| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | ID     | Category      | 
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Upstream Merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 10.15. See the community [Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10-15.html) for details.                                          |        |               |
| Bug Fix | Don't emit useless messages about GSS or SSL negotiation failures. [Support Tickets: #1048322, #1048143, #1018659] | DB-770 |  |
| Bug Fix | We create this system column for all the foreign tables. However, only `oci_dblink` and `libpq_dblink` FDWs use it and the code assumes that this column is used with these two FDWs only. That is incorrect. This commit fixes the assertion failure when system column `__remote_rowid_` is selected. | DB&#8209;749 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed handling of multi-character record separators in edbldr. [Support Ticket: #1051362] | DB-743 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed group estimate for the remote relation in `oci_dblink`. | DB-701 | |
| Bug Fix | In non-Pro*C mode, evaluate `EXEC SQL IFDEF/IFNDEF` expression irrespective of the enclosed 'C' preprocessor directives and emit all 'C' preprocessor directives as-is to the output file. [Support Ticket: #1007795] | DB-551 | ecpg |
| Bug Fix | Fix row incompatibility issue when `SUBTYPE` is used in composite type. | DB-107 | SPL |
