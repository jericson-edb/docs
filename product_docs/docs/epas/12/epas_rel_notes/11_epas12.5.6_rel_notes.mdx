EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12.5.6 includes the following bug fixes:

| Type | Description      | ID | Category |
| ---- | ---------------- | -- | -------- |
| Upstream Merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 12.5. See the community [Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/release-12-5.html) for details. |         |           |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | As `ROWIDs` are generated by the system internally, values for the `rowid` column are not dumped. Thus we should not dump the `rowid` sequence state using `setval()` too. Otherwise, it gives an error with data-only dump-restore. So skip dumping `ROWID` sequence state. [Support Ticket: #1095864] | DB-812 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed crash with `COPY FROM` and/or foreign partition routing operations performed on `libpq_dblink` and `oci_dblink` FDW table. |DB&#8209;804 | |
| Bug Fix | Don't emit useless messages about GSS or SSL negotiation failures. [Support Tickets: #1048322, #1048143, #1018659] | DB-770 |  |
| Bug Fix | Allow dynamic partition creation to non-owner insert queries. [Support Ticket: #1073281] | DB-769 | |
| Bug Fix | We create this system column for all the foreign tables. However, only `oci_dblink` and `libpq_dblink` FDWs use it and the code assumes that this column is used with these two FDWs only. That is incorrect. This commit fixes the assertion failure when system column `__remote_rowid_` is selected. | DB-749 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed handling of multi-character record separators in edbldr. [Support Ticket: #1051362] | DB-743 | |
| Bug Fix | Skip sending the `ROWID` to the subscriber. [Support Ticket: #1055674] | DB-734 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed server crash during split partition when using `edb_partition`. | DB-705 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed group estimate for the remote relation in `oci_dblink`. | DB-701 | |
| Bug Fix | In non-Pro*C mode, evaluate `EXEC SQL IFDEF/IFNDEF` expression irrespective of the enclosed 'C' preprocessor directives and emit all 'C' preprocessor directives as-is to the output file. [Support Ticket: #1007795] | DB-551 | ecpg |
| Bug Fix | Fix row incompatibility issue when `SUBTYPE` is used in composite type. | DB-107 | SPL |
