EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 installers support Linux and Windows server platforms. 

!!! Note
    Connectors Installer is supported on Windows 7, 8, and 10.

!!! Note
    Advanced Server is no longer supported on RHEL/CentOS/OL 6.x platforms. It is strongly recommended that EDB products running on these platforms be migrated to a supported platform.

See [Platform Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
 for additional information about supported platforms.
