The process of upgrading a PEM installation is platform-specific. You can update a PEM Agent or Server on a Linux platform by using the native packages and on a Windows platform by using the PEM graphical installer available for Windows. 

This section provides detailed information about upgrading the PEM components:

-   **Upgrading a PEM Installation on Linux** - Provides detailed information about upgrading your PEM Server, PEM Agent, and SQL Profiler from one major version to another on Linux platforms.
-   **Upgrading a PEM Installation on Windows** - Provides information about upgrading your PEM Server, PEM Agent, and SQL Profiler from one major version to another on the Windows platform.

!!! Note
    - Prior to PEM 7.8 release, PEM Agent or Server could be installed on Linux either by using the     
      graphical installer or by using the RPMs. 
    - From PEM version 7.8 onwards, PEM graphical installers for Linux are discontinued. To upgrade a 
      PEM Agent or Server on a Linux host from any lower version to PEM 7.9 or higher versions, you must use native packages.

Links to PEM installers and RPMs are available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).
